Every .NET project I work on, I add a small collection of unit testing libraries I personally consider essential.

 * [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit)
   > xUnit.net is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework.

 * [Shouldly](https://docs.shouldly.io/)
   > Shouldly is an assertion framework which focuses on giving great error messages when the assertion fails while being simple and terse.

 * [NSubstitute](https://nsubstitute.github.io/)
   > A friendly substitute for .NET mocking libraries.

   > Mock, stub, fake, spy, test double? Strict or loose? Nah, just substitute for the type you need!

 * [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture)
   > Write maintainable unit tests, faster.

    > AutoFixture makes it easier for developers to do Test-Driven Development by automating non-relevant Test Fixture Setup, allowing the Test Developer to focus on the essentials of each test case.
