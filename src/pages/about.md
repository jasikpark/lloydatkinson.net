Hey, I'm Lloyd. I'm a software developer. I'm interested in a number of subject areas, including software development, embedded systems, and electronics. I'm active in the online developer community and like to help others.

I advocate for making and designing software well. Clean code, unit testing, maintainable and extensible code.

This is my place on the internet where I take notes, share knowledge, advocate for best practices, write articles on topics I'm passionate about, occasionally rant about things, and share my creative projects. 

I made this site with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). It's styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
