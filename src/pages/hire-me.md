I'm passionate about what I do. I care deeply about software design and architecture and I advocate for practices like TDD and good development processes. I enjoy it and I find the process to be fun. Helping developers produce value is what I aim for. Whether it's small jobs, freelance, consulting, or longer commitments - here's some of what I can do for you:

🧰 **Custom software development.** With experience of a number of languages and frameworks, I can help build your software. Either from scratch or refactoring an existing project.

📝 **TDD/Unit Testing.** Designing software well requires confidence in both the specification and code. I've introduced unit testing on multiple projects to ensure correctness and maintainability.

⚙️ **Development process.** I've experienced several different methodologies of developing software, including Agile. I have experience with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, and IaC (Infrastructure as Code) with GitHub Actions. I can help take your tedious and manual build and deployment processes to use modern IaC and CI/CD.

🔍 **Code review.** I'm happy to review your code and create a report of the findings, or I can implement the changes required for you. I start with running code quality tools, and then look at areas such as code style, documentation, and code coverage. In particular I look for issues with maintainability, readability, code duplication, strong coupling, encapsulation, etc. I also review the build and deployment process of the code under review.

📚 **Full stack development.** I've worked across a wide spectrum of technologies and platforms. Desktop, backend, frontend. I have considerable experience with languages and ecosystems such as C#/.NET, Node, Javascript, and Typescript. I also have experience of desktop development, event driven architecture, microservices, serverless, message queues, and cloud native development. Additionally I have experience with NestJS. On the frontend side of things, I have experience with Vue and React SPAs, web components, and building Tailwind CSS based design systems.

☁️ **Cloud development with Azure.** I've designed several types of systems with Azure; batch, microservices, serverless, etc. I have experience with ARM/Bicep templates, Azure Storage (Table, Queue Storage), Azure Functions, and Azure Event Grid. My preferred workflow for Azure is a combination of GitHub Actions and IaC with ARM/Bicep, to ensure a smooth deployment workflow.
