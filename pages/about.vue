                    I'm Lloyd. I'm a software developer and maker. I'm interested in a number of subject areas, including software development, embedded systems, and electronics.

                <p>
                    I advocate for making and designing software well. Clean code, unit testing, maintainable and extensible code.

                    This is my place on the internet where I take notes, write articles about topics I'm passionate about, rant about things, and share my creative projects.
